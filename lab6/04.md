# Network Forensics

Network Forensics is a sub-branch of Digital Forensics concerned with monitoring and analysis of computer network traffic for two main purposes:

- **Intrusion Detection**: to identify malicious/anomalous traffic and extract IoCs (file hashes, IP addresses, URLs/domain names).
- **Law enforcement**: to investigate a CyberCrime and extract legal evidence for court proceedings.

An advantage and a disadvantage:

- (+) Collected data persists even if the compromised system was wiped
- (-) Requires setup beforehand as data is typically transmitted then lost

Analysts commonly inspect traffic (live or post-incident) to obtain useful information about the incident.

Popular tooling include: Tcpdump, netsniff-ng, wireshark, Zeek, Arkime, and Suricata.

## Exercise 4

A packet capture `exfil.pcap` is provided ([source](https://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/2025/01/31/index.html)). It records a data exfiltration scenario over FTP.

Analyze the file to answer some questions.

> You may upload it to an online service like [apackets](https://apackets.com/) or analyze it locally with Wireshark or other tools.

- What is the domain name of the contacted FTP server? Where is it located?
- What is username and password used to login to the FTP server?
- What is the address of the local DNS server contacted by the victim?
- Obtain and show the exfiltrated data.
