# Digital Forensics

Digital forensics involves the recovery, investigation, examination, and analysis of material found in digital devices, often in relation to a cybercrime.

Digital evidence can be extracted from a variety of sources, including computers (storage disks, volatile memory), mobile/embedded devices, networks, databases, cloud infrastructure, and any other computerized information systems.

## Process

> <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_forensic_process>

A digital forensic investigation typically consists of 3 stages: imaging, analysis, and reporting.

- **Imaging**: to acquire a digital evidence in a manner that protects and preserves the original.
- **Analysis**: to identify evidence that either supports or contradicts a hypothesis.
- **Reporting**: to write an expert conclusion for passing to authorities along with the evidence itself.

Two basic levels of personnel are needed:

- A **technician** performs imaging (and potentially live analysis) at a crime scene, they are trained to correctly handle evidence.
- An **examiner** specializes in the analysis of certain evidence artifacts.

## Tooling

Specialized tooling helps accelerate and simplify the digital forensic process. Below is a shortlist of popular free or open-source tools.

- [Guymager](https://www.kali.org/tools/guymager/): open-source GUI forensic imager for dumping disks as EWF, AFF or dd (raw) formats.
- [FTKImager](https://www.exterro.com/digital-forensics-software/ftk-imager): the free edition allows creating and inspecting forensic images.
- [Autopsy](https://github.com/sleuthkit/autopsy): digital forensics platform and GUI to The Sleuth Kit (TSK).
- [Volatility](https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility3): open-source framework for memory forensics.
- [Plaso](https://github.com/log2timeline/plaso) and [Timesketch](https://github.com/google/timesketch): for creation and analysis of forensic timelines.
- [Eric Zimmerman tools](https://ericzimmerman.github.io/#!index.md): collection of analysis tools, mostly focused on Windows forensics.

Specialized Linux distros like [CAINE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAINE_Linux) are shipped with some of these tools pre-installed.
