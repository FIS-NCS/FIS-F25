# Scanning

Active reconnaissance involves interacting with a target to gather information needed for an attack.

> The more traffic a scan generates, the less stealthy the attack gets, increasing the chance of detection, rate-limiting, and eventual blocking.

## Practice

1. Launch a vulnerable container from VulHub inside the lab network [[ref.](https://github.com/vulhub/vulhub/blob/master/langflow/CVE-2025-3248/docker-compose.yml)].

   ```yaml
   docker run -d --name vuln --network lab_net vulhub/activemq:5.17.3
   ```

1. Verify reachability from attacker to victim container.

   ```bash
   ping vuln
   ```

1. Install nmap (also check [Zenmap GUI](https://flathub.org/en/apps/org.nmap.Zenmap))

   ```bash
   sudo apt install nmap
   ```

1. Run a full port scan against the application (check [nmap tldr page](https://tldr.inbrowser.app/pages/common/nmap))

   ```bash
   nmap -p- vuln
   ```

1. Perform an aggressive scan against a certain port (definitely not stealthy, performs service+system+script scanning)

   ```bash
   nmap -A -p61616 vuln
   ```

## Exercise 3

Perform similar steps to deploy and scan the container from your chosen CVE in Exercise 1.
