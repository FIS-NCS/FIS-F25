# Lab Environment

Hello there!

If you're seeing this description with a live terminal on the right, you've successfully started the lab environment. **Set a username to get started!**

## Terminal Environment

We've prepared a terminal environemnt for you to learn and experiment.

- It's based on an unminimized Ubuntu 24.04 docker container
- It has access to Docker CLI of the host

## Tooling

This terminal environment uses [Fish](https://fishshell.com/) shell running in [Zellij](https://zellij.dev/documentation/) terminal workspace v0.43.1

- Session name is shown in the terminal header and navigation shortcuts are shown in the footer.
- Only a single browser tab can be active at a time. A second tab will hijack the terminal of the first one.
- Zellij [config](https://zellij.dev/documentation/configuration.html) (`zellij.kdl`) is accessible in case you want to customize the terminal looks or behavior (e.g., enabling/disabling `mouse_mode`)
- Open links shown within terminal with Shift + Click

## Recording

- The terminal session is being recorded with [asciinema](https://asciinema.org/).

- Once you `exit` the terminal (Ctrl+D), the recording can be uploaded to your channel, make sure you create an account to keep the recording available.

- Recordings are available in your project directory
  - You can always retrieve and upload them manually if the automatic upload didn't work for some reason.
  - You can upload them manually later with `asciinema upload <cast_file>`.

## Using host terminal

If you prefer to use your host's environment, simply install an ssh server on your host (e.g., `sudo apt install openssh-server`) then connect to it from our terminal like `ssh <USER>@<DOCKER_BRIDGE_IP>`
