# Dynamic Analysis

Dynamic analysis of a malware sample typically requires running it in a sandbox (e.g., a virtual machine with limited networking capabilities).

- Advanced malware may perform **sandbox detection** to resist dynamic analysis.

It's usually a good idea to utilize a mix of static and dynamic approaches. For example:

1. Running the malware in a sandbox first to get an overall idea about its behavior
1. Then diving into the - usually obfuscated - code to reveal hidden logic paths

## Tooling

One may carefully build a sandbox environment using virtual machines, but existing solutions are available:

- Online services: [ANY.RUN](https://any.run), [Joe Sandbox](https://www.joesandbox.com/)
- [Cuckoo](https://github.com/cuckoosandbox/cuckoo): self-hosted malware analysis environment (usable, but unmaintained).
- [Sandboxie](https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie): isolation software for Windows.

## Practice

- Follow the article on Remcos Remote Access Trojan (RAT) analysis at <https://any.run/malware-trends/remcos/>.
- Try to reproduce the results shown there. You can download a sample from [MalwareBazaar](https://bazaar.abuse.ch/sample/d35e48bfb4fbfa07d0f58cba44465922f683a84d8235601e3259d4405fefccb5/)

## Exercise 4

1. Select a malware that you want to analyze (e.g., from [TheZoo](https://https//github.com/ytisf/theZoo))

2. Upload the malware to a sandboxing solution like [ANY.RUN](https://any.run) or [Joe Sandbox](https://www.joesandbox.com/)

3. Explain the overall behavior of the malware:

   - Provide screenshots and explanations about relevant IoCs detected by the sandbox.

   - Try to explain a logical flow (story) of actions performed by the malware

   - Use the article from practice section as a guide.
