# Malicious Software

A malware is intentionally designed to do harmful behavior to computer systems and networks. Researchers categorize malware based on its behavior.

- Popular types include viruses, ransomware, worms, trojans, backdoors, logic bombs, and key loggers.
- Spyware and adware (sometimes called grayware) are often included in the mix.

## Malware Analysis

Researchers analyze malware to understand the functionality, origin, and impact on systems.

- **Static Analysis** involves examining the malware without executing it, using techniques such as disassembly and decompilation to reverse engineer the code and understand its functionality.
- **Dynamic Analysis** involves executing the malware in a controlled environment (such as a sandbox) and observing its behavior.

## Practice

- Install ClamAV (popular open-source antivirus engine for detecting malware)

   ```bash
   sudo apt install clamav
   ```

- Download [EICAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EICAR_test_file) (sample file to test antivirus systems)

   ```bash
   mkdir sample && cd sample
   wget https://secure.eicar.org/eicar.com.txt
   ```

- Update database of virus signatures (<https://lists.clamav.net/pipermail/clamav-virusdb/>)

   ```bash
   sudo freshclam
   ```

- Run a scan for a directory, only showing infected files ([clamscan tldr page](https://tldr.inbrowser.app/pages/common/clamscan)).

   ```shell
   clamscan -i -r <dir>
   ```
