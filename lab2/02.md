# Basic Authentication

1. Add a single admin user and password

   ```python
   from flask import Flask
   from flask_httpauth import HTTPBasicAuth

   app = Flask(__name__)
   auth = HTTPBasicAuth(app)

   @auth.verify_password
   def verify_password(username, password):
      if username == 'admin' and password == 'admin':
         return username

   @app.route('/')
   @auth.login_required
   def home():
      return f'<h1>Hello, {auth.current_user()}</h1>'

   if __name__ == '__main__':
      app.run()
   ```

2. Try accessing homepage without credentials

   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:5000
   ```

3. Try again with credentials

   ```bash
   curl -u admin:admin http://localhost:5000
   ```

## Exercise 2

Assuming we don't know the username and password, but we know they're probably something default/trivial. We can quickly test our hypothesis with `hydra`:

1. Install `hydra` with `apt`

2. Download appropriate wordlists E.g., from [SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists)
   - You don't have to clone the full repository. For now, just `wget` the files you need

3. Launch the attack (check help menu for parameters)
